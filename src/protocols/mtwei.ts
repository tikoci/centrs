/**
 * MTWEI — MikroTik's EC-SRP authentication for MAC-Telnet (the modern default).
 *
 * Classic MD5 MAC-Telnet auth is rejected by current RouterOS (verified on CHR
 * 7.23: a stock device offers a 16-byte salt but refuses the MD5 proof for valid
 * credentials). The supported method is MTWEI — the shared EC-SRP5 proof (see
 * `ec-srp5.ts`) wrapped in MAC-Telnet's control framing. The password never
 * crosses the wire; MTWEI authenticates the login but does **not** encrypt the
 * subsequent terminal stream.
 *
 * The curve math, point encoding, identity validator, keygen, and client proof
 * are the protocol-agnostic EC-SRP5 core in `ec-srp5.ts`. This module adds the
 * MAC-Telnet-specific framing (the username-prefixed offer value) and re-exports
 * the EC-SRP5 primitives under their historical `mtwei*` names so MAC-Telnet code
 * and tests keep importing from here unchanged.
