# explain

Analyze a RouterOS command **before** anything runs it: canonical form and
structure, LSP-like token spans and diagnostics, how the command would actually
run (`api`-able vs `execute`-required, including a rendered REST/`curl` form),
and — against a live device — what commands, arguments, and values are valid at
a path, with completion-style candidates for building the right command.
`explain` is the "E" of the explain → validate → run split (constitution:
validation): the cheap, safe knowledge tier in front of the runners
(`execute` / `api` / `retrieve`).

Status: `designed` over `rest-api` and `native-api` — the transports the live
inspection probes ride; every other cell is `—`. The offline mode is
transport-less. See `docs/MATRIX.md` for the row. A first design round
(2026-07-19, recorded in #90) settled the surface shape and the offline model;
**the spec is not yet ratified** — ratification waits on a canonicalization
grounding pass (see [Staging](#definition-of-done-and-staging)), and every
flag/field name here is still provisional.
Load-bearing rules — envelope, errors, settings precedence, identity,
validation, protocol selection — live in
[`docs/CONSTITUTION.md`](../../docs/CONSTITUTION.md).

## Why (grounding)

- `~/GitHub/bench-routeros-tools` (`REPORT.md`) grounds the split empirically:
  agents need a cheap, safe knowledge/validation tier gating a thin runner, and
  a handful of verbs over canonical `{path, verb, args}` beats per-command
  tools. It also measured the **inspect-vs-runtime gap** (`/console/inspect`
  accepted `blackhole=yes` where the runtime wanted the bare flag): schema
  acceptance is necessary, never sufficient.
- The wire-format research is done and public:
  [`routeros-syntax-inspection`](https://github.com/tikoci/routeros-skills/tree/main/routeros-syntax-inspection)
  (probe selection, highlight/parseIL/completion/child/syntax semantics,
  hazards, provenance rules) and
  [`routeros-command-tree`](https://github.com/tikoci/routeros-skills/tree/main/routeros-command-tree)
  (tree traversal, schema generation), both grounded by full-corpus captures in
  [tikoci/lsp-routeros-ts `docs/`](https://github.com/tikoci/lsp-routeros-ts/tree/main/docs)
  (913 scripts × 7.9.2/7.23.2/7.24rc2). This spec cites those references
  rather than restating them; they are the canonical wire truth.
- Decisions locked in #90: `validate` stays **boolean** (the dry-run gate
  inside `execute`/`api` and `centrs_validate`); `explain` is the surface that
  carries richness; centrs is the **canonicalizer/explain owner** and
  `lsp-routeros-ts` (and tikbook) eventually consume the centrs library
  instead of owning their own analysis core.
- Boundary from rosetta B-0013 (#175), sharpened by the 2026-07-19 round:
  rosetta owns *static, docs-grounded* explanation — prose, URLs, version
  history, "what version supports what" — and never grows validate/run; centrs
  owns canonicalization and anything device-aware. **centrs does not call
  rosetta, and does not consume restraml/rosetta schema data, for now**: the
  projects stay decoupled until centrs's final shape is known. At most,
  `explain` output may *steer* toward rosetta in a tip (e.g. "for docs/version
  history, ask rosetta"). Deeper integration (for example rosetta publishing
  stable GitHub-Pages links centrs help could cite) is future rosetta-side
  work, tracked there, not here.

## Where `explain` sits

- **Never executes, never mutates.** All live probes (`/console/inspect`
  highlight/completion/syntax/child and `:put [:parse …]`) are read-only
  inspection. Execution-based probes (required-argument discovery via
  deliberate errors) are out of scope — they belong to research tooling, not
  this verb.
- **`validate` is unchanged.** `--validate` remains the boolean gate on the
  runners; `explain` is what you call when you want to know *why*, or to build
  the command in the first place. Internally they share machinery; externally
  they stay distinct surfaces (constitution: validation).
- **The structured-mode gate stays authoritative.** `explain` exposes the
  canonicalizer's verdict (`mode`, `writeShaped`) but must not widen what
  counts as `structured` (constitution: canonicalizer ownership).
- **Passing `explain` is not a promise the router will accept the command.**
  Every result carries this asymmetry explicitly (see
  [Result shape](#result-shape-sketch)); only `execute`/`api` against a real
  target proves runtime acceptance.
- **Library-first.** The deliverable is exported functions on `@tikoci/centrs`
  that need no CLI and (offline) no CDB; the CLI verb and the MCP tool are
  thin adapters. centrs ships no LSP server, but the library API must be able
  to **support one**: hover, diagnostics, completion, and semantic-token needs
  of `lsp-routeros-ts`/tikbook are first-class consumers of the export shape.

## Canonicalization is the core

The engine is a **grown `canonicalizeExecuteCommand`** (decision: grow the
in-repo canonicalizer; rosetta's pure `canonicalize.ts` is reference material
to borrow from as needed, with **no sync obligation** — centrs solves a
different problem and is expected to diverge). Target capabilities, beyond
today's path/verb/args split and script-vs-structured gate:

- **Structure, not just segmentation.** Parse RouterOS input into an AST-like
  structure so complex expressions, blocks, and scopes can be identified —
  including multi-statement `.rsc` scripts.
- **Sub-command resolution with re-constituted paths.** In
  `/ip/address remove [find comment=defconf]`, the inner `find` carries the
  enclosing path (`ip,address`); the canonical structure exposes that inner
  command with its resolved path rather than treating `[…]` as an opaque blob.
- **Transport classification.** For each statement, say how it would actually
  run: representable as a structured `api` operation (and if so, the REST
  method/path/body), or `execute`-required (script mode, expressions,
  sub-commands). This is how `explain` teaches the caller the right runner —
  including rendering a ready-to-use `curl` form for REST-able commands and
  the `centrs execute`/`centrs api` invocation for either.
- **Heuristics owned and labeled.** Offline conclusions are canonicalizer
  facts (provenance `canonicalizer`, basis `heuristic`/`derived`) — never
  presented as device or schema truth.

There are real unknowns in how far offline parsing can go (expression
grammar, scope fidelity vs `:parse`, `[]`-nesting corner cases). Grounding
those unknowns is **phase 0** below and gates ratifying this spec.

## Three questions, one pipeline

An agent (the primary caller) asks `explain` three kinds of question before
touching `execute` / `api` / `retrieve`:

1. **Check** — *"is this command right, and how does it run?"*
   `/ip/route add dst-address=10.9.0.0/16 blackhole=yes` → canonical
   `{path, verb, args, mode, writeShaped}`, spans, diagnostics, transport
   classification (+ `curl`/runner rendering on request).
2. **Assist** — *"what can come next?"*
   `/ip/firewall/filter add ch` + cursor → completion candidates with
   provenance, so the caller composes a correct command instead of guessing
   and retrying.
3. **Describe** — *"what exists at this path?"* (live)
   A broad query returns broader, **bounded** results that invite drill-down:
   - `/ip/address` → the verbs available there (with arg counts or a hint to
     name a verb for its args);
   - `/ip/address/set` → the settable arguments;
   - `/ip/address/print` → special-cased to the `.proplist` value set, i.e.
     what the output *can* contain.

Offline, `explain` answers with canonicalizer facts only (structure, gate,
transport shape). Enumerating what a device accepts — verbs, args, enums,
`.proplist` sets — is **live** evidence; a no-router run that would benefit says so
with a tip ("richer data is available if you name a router").

## Evidence modes

| Mode | Trigger | Sources | Provenance label |
| ---- | ------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| **Offline** (default) | no `<router>` given | the centrs canonicalizer only: segmentation, AST-like structure, path/verb/args split, script-vs-structured, write-shape, transport classification, `curl`/runner rendering | `canonicalizer` (basis `heuristic`/`derived`) |
| **Live** | `<router>` given | `request=highlight` (byte-classified spans, first hard error), `:parse` (structure, error line/column), `request=completion` / `syntax` / `child` (candidates, structured help, children/args/`.proplist` sets) | `live-inspect`, stamped with the device's version |

There is **no static schema snapshot** (decision, 2026-07-19): offline mode
does not consult restraml `inspect.json`/`deep-inspect.json` or rosetta data —
version/schema questions are steered to a live router (or to rosetta, by tip).
Offline diagnostics are therefore structural ("this does not parse", "this is
script-shaped"), never existence claims about paths or arguments.

A live target arrives through the **same resolver as every other command**
(CDB name/MAC/group keys, `--quickchr`, future TikTOML — #134/#174): a
target-aware `explain` gets provider targets for free and adds no bespoke
resolution path. Fan-out does not apply — `explain` takes at most one router
and rejects selectors with `usage/fanout-not-supported`, like `terminal`.

Implementation-normative safety rules (evidence in the skill/LSP references):
per-probe timeouts always; skip scripting-keyword paths for `syntax`/
`completion` on ≤ 7.20.8 (REST-server deadlock, fixed 7.21.4, SUP-127641);
route input past the 32,767-byte highlight cap to `:parse` or report
truncation — never analyze a silent prefix; offsets are **UTF-8 byte** offsets
over ASCII-normalized input and the normalization is recorded; `[]`, timeout,
and transport failure stay distinct outcomes.

## Surface (Option A — decided)

```bash
centrs explain "<input>" [<router>] [flags]
```

`<input>` is a command, a script fragment (`--file` / stdin for scripts), or a
bare menu path. One verb serves all three intents; the accepted risk is that
the refined "broad query → broader results" scheme adds complexity to one
surface rather than splitting into sub-verbs. (Option B — sub-verbs
`explain check|complete|path` — and Option C — folding into the runners — were
considered and set aside; C is rejected outright: the bench grounds a
*separable* cheap tier, offline explain has no runner to ride, and MCP already
serves `centrs_explain` with no CDB.)

**Smart sizing, not depth knobs.** There is no `--depth`. `explain` returns a
*reasonable* amount by default: when more detail is cheap it is included; when
a subtree (paths × verbs × args) is large, it returns **counts plus a warning
that the tree was truncated**, with hints for the narrower query that expands
the interesting part. A single override flag — working name `--full`, final
name TBD — lifts the size limits regardless of result size.

| Flag | Adds | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| *(base)* | canonical structure, spans, diagnostics, transport classification | offline: pure canonicalizer; live: + highlight + `:parse` |
| `--complete [--cursor <byte>]` | continuation candidates at the cursor (default: end of input) | live evidence; offline emits the live-target tip |
| `--schema` | path enumeration: verbs, args, types, enums, `.proplist` | live evidence; offline emits the live-target tip |
| `--curl` | rendered REST call (`curl …`) for `api`-able statements, plus the equivalent `centrs api`/`centrs execute` invocation | offline-capable; uses a placeholder host when no router is given |
| `--full` *(name TBD)* | lift smart-sizing limits | — |

Rendering stays separate: `--format`/`--json` remain the settings-vocabulary
output switch. The longer-term wish behind "format levels" — a colorized
breakdown of the command (e.g. unset attributes in grey) — is a **rendering**
concern for the CLI/TUI layer over the same data, not a richness level.

Exit codes follow the `check` pattern: `0` clean, `2` when diagnostics meet
`--fail-on <error|warning|never>` (default `error`), `1` on command failure.

## Result shape (sketch)

Standard envelope (constitution: result envelope); `data` sketch:

```json
{
  "input": { "bytes": 58, "normalized": false, "truncated": false },
  "canonical": { "path": "/ip/route", "verb": "add", "args": { "dst-address": "10.9.0.0/16", "blackhole": "yes" }, "mode": "structured", "writeShaped": true },
  "structure": { "statements": 1, "blocks": [], "subcommands": [ { "path": "/ip/address", "verb": "find", "span": { "start": 19, "end": 42 } } ] },
  "transport": { "runner": "api", "rest": { "method": "PUT", "path": "/rest/ip/route" }, "curl": "curl -u … https://<router>/rest/ip/route …", "centrs": "centrs api <router> …" },
  "spans": [ { "start": 0, "end": 9, "class": "path" } ],
  "diagnostics": [ { "severity": "warning", "code": "explain/canonicalizer/ambiguous-verb", "span": { "start": 42, "end": 55 }, "message": "…", "source": "canonicalizer" } ],
  "schema": { "path": "/ip/address", "verbs": [ { "name": "set", "argCount": 9 } ], "truncated": false },
  "completion": [ { "value": "chain", "kind": "argument", "source": "live-inspect" } ],
  "target": { "resolved": "chr1", "version": "7.23.1" },
  "runtimeAcceptance": "not-proven"
}
```

- **Every derived fact keeps provenance** — source (`canonicalizer` vs
  `live-inspect`), basis (direct response vs derived vs heuristic), version
  stamp when live, normalization, truncation, outcome. The
  `RouterOsSyntaxEvidence` contract in lsp-routeros-ts
  `docs/syntax-inspection-map.md` is the adaptation source.
- **Spans use a centrs-owned vocabulary** (decision): raw RouterOS highlight
  classes are not the default surface. The centrs vocabulary must be at least
  as rich as the RouterOS token classes, and centrs maintains the mapping —
  including color mappings derived from the original RouterOS highlight
  colors — so an LSP consuming centrs can reproduce the current RouterOS
  color scheme faithfully. The indirection decouples consumers from
  cross-version drift in the raw classes; raw classes stay available in
  provenance/debug output.
- Diagnostics are slash-namespaced (`explain/<source>/<slug>`), carry byte
  spans (or line/column from `:parse`), and follow the standard error-model
  severity channels.
- `runtimeAcceptance: "not-proven"` is structural, not boilerplate: it is the
  inspect-vs-runtime gap made machine-readable.
- Live-state token classes (disabled/dynamic/inactive object references)
  surface as facts, not errors; severity policy belongs to the caller.

## MCP and library surfaces

- `centrs_explain` today wraps `canonicalizeExecuteCommand` (offline, no CDB —
  the only tool that serves without one). It grows toward this spec
  **following the CLI scheme** (decision): same facets, same envelope-shaped
  data as the CLI's `--json`, optionally a CDB-resolved target for live
  evidence. The no-CDB offline path must survive, and the MCP adapter must
  not widen the structured gate.
- Library (sketch): `explainCommand(input, opts)` pure/offline;
  `explainCommand(input, { target, facets })` live. `lsp-routeros-ts` and
  tikbook are the intended external consumers (hover/diagnostics/completion/
  semantic tokens over these calls); an LSP *protocol* surface on centrs
  stays out of scope (#90) — but the export shape is validated against a real
  LSP consumption spike before it hardens (staging phase 5).

## Non-goals

- No LSP server in centrs — the LSP is a consumer the library must support,
  nothing more.
- No execution probes; no state mutation of any kind.
- No fan-out.
- No rosetta/restraml integration for now (decision): no shell-outs, no
  vendored schema/docs artifacts, no version-history facts. Output may tip
  toward rosetta for docs/version questions; revisit only after centrs's
  shape settles and rosetta publishes stable consumable surfaces.
- No promise of enum exhaustiveness or of the upstream `completion-tricks`
  synthetic-probe recipes (still open research in lsp-routeros-ts
  `BACKLOG.md`) — candidates are labeled as observed, not closed sets.

## Definition of done and staging

`designed` on the strength of this README. When implementation starts, offline
examples gate via unit/fixture tests and each live cell advances to
`CHR-passed` only when its `examples.md` entries run green via
`bun run test:integration` (constitution: done definition). Suggested staging
(sequence, not schedule):

0. **Canonicalization grounding lab** — experiments (corpus + CHR
   cross-checks against `:parse`/highlight) that establish what offline
   parsing can actually achieve: expression structure, block/scope
   resolution, sub-command path re-constitution, transport classification
   edge cases. **Ratifying this spec waits on this phase** — its findings are
   expected to refine the surface above.
1. **Offline core** — the grown canonicalizer: structure + gate verdict +
   transport classification + diagnostics (+ `--curl` rendering).
2. **Live probes** — highlight + `:parse` (+ completion/child/syntax facets)
   over rest-api/native-api with the safety rules above, including the
   broad-query describe ladder and smart sizing.
3. **Facet polish** — `--complete`/`--schema` ergonomics, truncation
   counts/hints, `--full`.
4. **Library/LSP alignment** — export shape hardened against a real
   lsp-routeros-ts consumption spike (semantic tokens via the centrs span
   vocabulary + color map).

## Decisions (2026-07-19 round) and remaining opens

Decided this round (details inline above; recorded in #90):

- **Option A** — one verb + facet flags; broad-query ladder
  (path → verbs, path/verb → args, `print` → `.proplist`); complexity of the
  refined scheme is an accepted risk.
- **Smart sizing** over `--depth`; counts + truncation warning for large
  subtrees; `--full` (name TBD) as the only override. `--format` stays a
  rendering switch; colorized command breakdown is a rendering feature.
- **No offline schema snapshot** — offline is the canonicalizer, full stop;
  schema/version truth comes from a live router (steered by tip) and
  docs/version history stays rosetta's domain.
- **No rosetta coupling for now** — at most steering tips; no calls, no
  artifacts, no maintained bindings.
- **centrs-owned span vocabulary** with RouterOS-fidelity color mapping for
  LSP consumers; raw highlight classes are provenance/debug, not the surface.
- **Grow `canonicalizeExecuteCommand`**; rosetta's `canonicalize.ts` is
  reference-only, divergence expected.
- **MCP mirrors the CLI scheme** and result shape.
- **Script-scale explain is in scope** — block/scope analysis and
  sub-command path re-constitution are target canonicalizer capabilities, and
  per-statement transport classification (execute vs api, `curl` rendering)
  is part of the base output.

Still open (for the next round / the grounding lab):

1. Final flag names (`--full`, `--curl`, facet names) and the smart-sizing
   thresholds (what counts as "cheap", what triggers truncation).
2. The centrs span vocabulary itself: class list, mapping table from RouterOS
   highlight classes (and their colors), and how unknown/new upstream classes
   degrade.
3. `curl` rendering scope: REST only (native-api has no curl analogue) —
   confirm placeholder-host behavior offline and credential elision rules.
4. The exact question list for the phase-0 grounding lab, and which spec
   claims it must confirm before ratification.
5. Whether the live describe ladder needs result caching per target+version
   (probe cost vs freshness) — likely deferred to implementation evidence.
